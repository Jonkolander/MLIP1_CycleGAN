!!IMPORTANT!! 

We only commented in code blocks that we implemented ourselves. 
The rest is from the template that we used based off the Monet 
CycleGAN tutorial from Amy Jang! We tried more things, such as 
Gaussian Noise, changing architecture etc. but these extra fe-
atures ended up in worse scores, so this is not visible in the
final version of this notebook.

The source code to what we tried at first can be found here:
